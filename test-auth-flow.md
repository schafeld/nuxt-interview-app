# Authentication Flow Test

## Test Steps

### 1. Initial State

- [ ] Visit <http://localhost:3001>
- [ ] Verify navigation menu is NOT visible (no user dropdown in header-right)
- [ ] Verify only logo and app title are visible in header

### 2. Registration Flow

- [ ] Fill out the signup form with new email/password
- [ ] Submit the form
- [ ] Verify redirect to /success page
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify user navigation menu appears in header-right immediately (no page reload needed)
- [ ] Verify user email is displayed in the dropdown
- [ ] Click "Continue to Profile" to go to /profile

### 3. Profile Page State

- [ ] Verify user menu is still visible in header
- [ ] Verify profile page shows user information
- [ ] Test logout from profile page "Sign Out" button
- [ ] Verify redirect to home page (/)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify user navigation menu disappears immediately (no page reload needed)

### 4. Login Flow (Existing User)

- [ ] Try to sign up again with same email but correct password
- [ ] Verify redirect to /success page
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify user navigation menu appears immediately
- [ ] Navigate to profile via menu or button

### 5. Logout from Navigation Menu

- [ ] Click user dropdown in navigation header-right
- [ ] Click "Sign Out" option
- [ ] Verify redirect to home page (/)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify user navigation menu disappears immediately

## Expected Results

✅ User navigation menu should appear immediately after login/registration
✅ User navigation menu should disappear immediately after logout (both methods)
✅ No page refresh should be required for menu visibility changes
✅ Authentication state should be consistent across all pages

## Current Issues Fixed

- Menu now appears immediately after login/registration
- Menu disappears immediately after logout from both profile page and nav menu
- Added proper watchers for authentication state changes
- Improved route-based auth state refresh
